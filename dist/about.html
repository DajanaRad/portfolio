          <h3>Biography</h3>
          <p>
            I am 23 years old. From Serbia, Golubinci. My journey of programming
            starts when I was waitress and bartender. I was trying to learn html
            and css as I was working every day. I wasn't content with how much I
            was learning. So I decide to quit, and dedicate myself to learning
            something completely new for me. As I was learning more and more, I
            start liking the power of making even small things. As I was making
            more complicated things the satisfaction was bigger. So I fell in
            love. And here I am now, with much more knowledge but also with
            awareness of hove many things I still don't know. I am trying not to
            be hard on myself if I didn't learn enough that day, of didn't at
            all. It's just that there is so much to learn. I am also passionate
            animal and nature lover.

          <p>
            In this moment I am improving all the code. I want it to be clean
            understandable code with newest features. Also, learning React, so i
            am at the begining of the journey of becoming a good developer with
            great skills. Main goal is to learn something new every day and make
            projects I would be proud of.
